## Description

The application displays the current hours and minutes in binary representation, in a grid format. The grid cells are filled white for '1' and gray for '0'. 

The binary representation is aligned from the right side, with the least significant bit at the rightmost. 

Additionally, a reference guide is displayed to help users interpret the binary numbers. 

## Prerequisites

The application requires Python and Pygame. 

You can download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

After you've installed Python, you can install Pygame via pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and type in the following command:

> pip install pygame


## Usage

To run the Python script `binary_clock.py` and start the application, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

> python binary_clock.py


You can quit the application by closing the Pygame window.

## ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT to do the heavy lifting, because I was lazy and this script is just for fun.
